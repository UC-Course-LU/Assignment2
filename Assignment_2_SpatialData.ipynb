Also let us know in which year the shapefiles were created and why this is relevant (hint: South Sudan). You might be able to find different shapefiles. Analyze your shapefiles. Like with any kind of \"real\" data, shapefiles can have *obstacles* that must be dealt with. For example, if your shapefile has islands, how do you define their adjacent countries? Shapefiles can also have *defects*. For example, an out of date shapefile might show old borders of a country, from when it used to border on another country that it's no longer adjacent to. Of course, if you're displaying historical data, that might be appropriate.\n",
